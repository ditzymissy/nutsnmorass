Random summaries of info on operating systems and software/apps (and maybe hardware).  Designed to be a quick 'cheat sheet' or app for a struggling IT professional or technician of a specific OS to slide into the other.  Especially for people cash, time and social-network 'strapped' and at odds with the money or social-network galore.  Attrib vs Chattr , echo vs print. int vs var.
