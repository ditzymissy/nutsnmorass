Random summaries of info on operating systems and software/apps (and maybe hardware).  Designed to be a quick 'cheat sheet' or app for a struggling IT professional or technician of a specific OS or software to slide into the alternative.  Designed as a short reference comparison manual or for an overview for a beginner.  Especially for people cash, time and social-network 'strapped' and at odds with the people with money or social-network galore.  Attrib vs Chattr, Windows Defender vs Iptables Vs UFW, echo vs print. int vs var.

This has been discontinued.

But for a similar 'concept', which contains alot of information for this project, can be found at https://ss64.com/. Easy to use.  Limitations were synonyms were used in various descriptions.  Technically, this project was inspired by this website ss64.  To be more specific, this project would have tables with the the values 'MacOs' (Mac), 'cmd' (windows), 'bash/unix' (Linux) and description.  Each row would contain a description of an action and the associated command of the OS.  The description would have been words that described the action of the command.
Example, one row would be:
Description- create a new user
Cmd- Net user username /add
Unix- useradd ; adduser
MacOs- dscl . -create /Users/username

This could have been furthered or advanced to an app like website.  The website or app containing a search widget with autocomplete drop-down list for easier usability.

Since revisiting the website, ss64, on 17/11/22, I think the website has been modified with some features that I was working on.
